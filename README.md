# Vendor Performance Analysis – Retail Inventory & Sales
#### Analyzing vendor efficiency and profitability to support strategic purchasing and inventory decisions using SQL, Python, and Power BI.

# Overview
#### This project evaluates vendor performance and retail inventory dynamics to drive strategic insights for purchasing, pricing, and inventory optimization. A complete data pipeline was built using SQL for ETL, Python for analysis and hypothesis testing, and Power BI for visualization.

# Business Problem
#### Effective inventory and sales management are critical in the retail sector. This project aims to:

#### Identify underperforming brands needing pricing or promotional adjustments
#### Determine vendor contributions to sales and profits
#### Analyze the cost-benefit of bulk purchasing
#### Investigate inventory turnover inefficiencies
#### Statistically validate differences in vendor profitability

# Dataset

#### Multiple CSV files located in /data/ folder (sales, vendors, inventory)
#### Summary table created from ingested data and used for analysis

#### Tools and Technologies

#### SQL (Common Table Expressions, Joins, Filtering)
#### Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)
#### Power BI (Interactive Visualizations)
#### GitHub

# Data Cleaning & Preparation

Removed transactions with:
#### Gross Profit ≤ 0
### Profit Margin ≤ 0
#### Sales Quantity = 0
#### Created summary tables with vendor-level metrics
### Converted data types, handled outliers, merged lookup tables

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Negative or Zero Values Detected:
#### Gross Profit: Min -52,002.78 (loss-making sales)
#### Profit Margin: Min -∞ (sales at zero or below cost)
#### Unsold Inventory: Indicating slow-moving stock
### Outliers Identified:

#### High Freight Costs (up to 257K)
#### Large Purchase/Actual Prices
### Correlation Analysis:
#### Weak between Purchase Price & Profit
### Strong between Purchase Qty & Sales Qty (0.999)
#### Negative between Profit Margin & Sales Price (-0.179)

# Research Questions & Key Findings

#### Brands for Promotions: 198 brands with low sales but high profit margins
#### Top Vendors: Top 10 vendors = 65.69% of purchases → risk of over-reliance
#### Bulk Purchasing Impact: 72% cost savings per unit in large orders
#### Inventory Turnover: $2.71M worth of unsold inventory
#### Vendor Profitability:
#### High Vendors: Mean Margin = 31.17%
#### Low Vendors: Mean Margin = 41.55%
#### Hypothesis Testing: Statistically significant difference in profit margins → distinct vendor strategies

# Dashboard
### Power BI Dashboard shows:
#### Vendor-wise Sales and Margins
#### Inventory Turnover
#### Bulk Purchase Savings
#### Performance Heatmaps

# Final Recommendations
#### Diversify vendor base to reduce risk
#### Optimize bulk order strategies
#### Reprice slow-moving, high-margin brands
#### Clear unsold inventory strategically
#### Improve marketing for underperforming vendors
